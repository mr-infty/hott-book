0. It is not explicitly assumed as a derivational rule in appendix A.2 that
   judgemental equality is a congruence relation with respect to *eliminators*
   (note that this *is* assumed in the rules of appendix A.1), at least as far
   as I can tell.
   Can this property be proven meta-theoretically?
